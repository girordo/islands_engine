# Functional Web Development with Elixir and Phoenix

This project is based on the book **Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix** from Pragmatic Programmer. It demonstrates how to build robust, maintainable, and scalable web applications using the Elixir programming language and the Phoenix framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Elixir**: A dynamic, functional programming language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
- **Phoenix**: A web development framework for Elixir that provides a productive and reliable environment for building modern web applications.
- **OTP (Open Telecom Platform)**: A set of libraries and tools built on top of the Erlang virtual machine that provides a powerful and fault-tolerant infrastructure for building distributed systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/girordo/islands_engine.git
   ```

2. Install Elixir and Phoenix by following the official installation guides:

   - Elixir: [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
   - Phoenix: [https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```
   cd islands_engine
   mix deps.get
   ```

4. Set up the database (if applicable):

   ```
   mix ecto.setup
   ```

5. Start the Phoenix server:

   ```
   mix phx.server
   ```

6. Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the application in action.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Phoenix application structure. Here are the key directories and files:

- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files for the application.
- **`lib/`**: Contains the main application code.
- **`priv/`**: Contains private files used by the application.
- **`test/`**: Contains test files for the application.
